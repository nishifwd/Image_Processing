# fourier_transform_gui
Streamlit app to visualise the effect of Fourier Transform in Image Processing

You can check the Steramlit App deloyed on Heroku [here](https://fourier-transform-my-image.herokuapp.com/)

## What is FOURIER TRANSFORM? 
In mathematics, a Fourier transform (FT) is a mathematical transform that decomposes functions depending on space or time into functions depending on spatial or temporal frequency, such as the expression of a musical chord in terms of the volumes and frequencies of its constituent notes. The term Fourier transform refers to both the frequency domain representation and the mathematical operation that associates the frequency domain representation to a function of space or time.

## Why this App? 

I am a kind of student who learns a new conecpt by playing around with it. I created this application so that I can load any image and play around with the Fourier Transform of the Image and check what value in the fourier transformed image stores which information about the original image. 

I created this application such that it gives a platform where anyone can play around with the fourier transformation of the image and then to learn more about it through the process. 

### FUN FACT 
This project was mentioend in the [Weekly Roundups of Streamilt Community Forum](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/weekly-roundup-memory-usage-improvements-molecule-stl-files-plotting-apps-and-more/18624), and I recieved a hand written note from Streamlit for this project.
